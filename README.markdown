This is a project binding [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com) and porting its demos to Opa.

For now the only working functionality is:

* Sortables (default demo)
* Draggables

Running
-------

First, you'll need to [download jQuery UI 1.8.18](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/zipball/1.8.18) to the directory `jquery-ui-1.8.18` as its not distributed together with this project.

Then `make` and you can run your `demo.exe`.

For your convenience a live demo is also available at: http://jquery-ui.tutorials.opalang.org/
